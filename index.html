                    This is "Taphee" aka Abhay Verma. His grandfather is wet(vet) and his father is a gynaecologist. He has a twisted sense of humour and likes playing games and looking at bobs and vegena. I met this asshole in class 9th when we had computer classes together in school. When I first met him, he used to make fun of me and troll me and used to get offended. Then one day in the computer lab, I saved my file as "sarla_and_tarla" and he was flabbergasted. Being a 9th standard boi, this was the coolest thing he could imagine. Then we got together and started trolling others. He pursues to be a dalaal and open his own GB Road. He his really very ambitious about this and has already started to plan out everything. He also wants to be a high level stoner. If you ever wanna hear some dark and dank jokes, he is the person I'll recommend because he does not only read a joke, he learns it. He has also memorized many of Carry Minati's videos.<br>
                    When he has a crush on any girl, he starts trolling her and eventually gets ignored. His last known crush is Divya Valecha but he wants to fuck Pinky Valecha(Divya's mother), for some strange unknown reasons.<br>
                    He hates everything about bengalis except that the girls there are thicc. He really enjoys pissing off people till they are ready to murder him. He has tried this on me several times but I can recall only one occassion when I really wanted to do that.<br>
                    After everything he is, he is a nice lad and a good son and also a great friend.

                    This is "Baba" aka "Hacker Wale Bhaiya" aka Prasenjit Gautam "aur iska kisiko dekh kar khada nahi hota hai". He also has a twisted sense of humour and likes trolling big personalities. I met this fucker in class 9th. Although he is a 1 year senior, neither of my friends has any respect for him for being elder than us, although I personally respect him for not showing off elderness like others. This asshole is an Ethical Hacker and some other things that I don't know but I'll put it up once I ask him. If you ever want to hear a lecture with a 90% "gaali" composition which might include you mother and sisters and grandmas and others of your family(dead included), you just need to tell him that you want to get a facebook or instagram account hacked.<br>
                    He is an achiever. For me, his biggest achievement in life is that he got a wife at the age of 16(in 21st century). He has a badass mama "Guddu" who I would like to meet someday. He once slapped me real hard because I pushed him towards a girl who he did not like at all. The next day, he hugged me and the the first thing I asked was-"Chhakke ho kya be ?" and the silence after that said it allüòÇ.<br>
                    We have been great brothers since then.
